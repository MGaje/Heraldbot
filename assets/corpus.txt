brittle is totally not imping any more :(
Are you casting it on asimir?
killing these guys without a shield is proving dangerous
i'm doing worse without a shield than without scale amour
bah
level 3 wc :D
jerk
Asimir no estÃ¡.
He'd be less lost with trig?
Hi Oyerth!
o hi thar!
*AES
and I want to compare
but I can't figure out which one it is with a google search
Could just be idiosyncratic to the programmer, too.
not unless he wrote the symbol table himself
it's not like he named it _start() himself :p
*pun*
I just did some research
Cross-compiled, maybe?
I think it's gcc run on cygwin
and a bunch of gotos
each function uses a few local variables as though they were not local variables
i.e. it makes use of where they are in memory and the stuff relative to them
Heh.
Be back later.
it's ok
OH BOY
Looks like a nice, warm day out too

I guess he's not used to being kicked
it's totally not his birthday in my time zone, but it is in yours!
HAHA I AUTO-REJOINED
it makes it so much easier
so fuck you
it's a shortcut
actually, that might be something to do with you alerting your VERSION request response when the server stated that your client must respond to VERSION requests
like on xchat you could make a button that does it

It seems like every time I have to do something with the government student loan site, I have to request my PIN since I can never remember it.
or put it in a text file
I keep all sorts of sensitive data in a single text file
namely ~/pin.txt

too many people freak out about putting sensitive data on your computer, but if the attacker has access to your hard disc, I figure you have already lost.
I suggest reversing the polarity on the power couplings
I have no idea who is going to know my exact whereabouts.

The rest of the presidential portraits are all like "Oh, hey. What's up? I'm the President. Let's be friends." but his is like "I AM IN SO MUCH INNER PAIN."

Hi Picso!
Hi, Zyr!
Hello, Mibbitite
Curt is a SOP
it seems simpler to just stop using Windows
its what happens when you visit porn all day
tell your dad to stop
I like how the Togekiss has its head up the Rampardos's arse
hmm
the one in the middle just has an awful haircut
All kids have awful haircuts. :(
it's not really him, no
Wait, it just got moved around for no reason
zomg
i'm trying to find an alternative to winamp. vlc blows
and i don't like wmp
songbird blows too
i guess i'm stuck with winamp
use the Bard!
There are no frog babies here.
i'm not fucking k-hos
just nanobots
you have to have sex with a pig to get swine aids!
yes! :D
HAHAHAHA
k-hos. he's going to hurt me :(
nooooo
i was just offering you a chocolate bar :(
oh lag, heh
And there's another ship just circling us, not doing anything. And he won't offer assistance. :(
I thought you were talking about real life
EV Nova.
pyglet
:S
also what the fuck, the y coord 0 is at the bottom of the window
take the north exit!
there are baby spiders out there
I usually just have one window open with vi and another with a Python interpreter running.
I use gedit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit
you should go to a really tall building and stand just outside it
There aren't any tall buildings in Manistee. :|
fatty!
You're not allowed in the 21st century if you don't have tall buildings
But it's beautiful from down by the beach!
Fuck it
:O :O :o
DRAMA!
pew pew pew
you shouldn't shoot helpless things
It's like candy.
OMG ITS ASIMIR
some random newbie :p
so we copied him :D
ha
no he's not smart enough for that
not smart enough to say "OMG EEEEEEEE" at random?
the original OMG EEEEEE happened in TKChat
so i can't search for it :(
follow along
noob
It's the chatroom we had before we moved to IRC
better
your mom keeps her python interpreter running too ;)
It's a tiny little thing that looks like a bird.

balaclava
Their answers are possum, snake, and scorpion.
so you would rather eat bugs?
really? http://paleo.cc/ce/scorpion.jpg
I know what a scorpion looks like.
I'd rather eat the scorpion than the possum.
my teeth have been hurting recently
so I've been brushing them in the middle of the day too, as well as in the morning and night
hold still
I'll have to remove your lower jaw so I can look at it
My teeth used to hurt a lot, so I started using sensitive toothpaste, and I guess it fills in microcracks in your teeth so nothing can get in.
but I guess it's still just because it's different
As your dentist, I suggest you switch back to your old toothpaste.
He pulls on my tongue now for some reason, and also feels to make sure my jaw is working properly. :|
it's not rape if you agree to it
My assistant might need to drill.
I have like 4 of them
Sleeping now.

Dangerous actions!
Call of Duty 5 is 50% on Steam this weekend :)
Blow on them!
I'm having an irn bru :)
Is that pronounced like "urn brew"?

Apparently Irn Bru is available here, but I've never seen it
With a little help, they all can be blacklisted.

I removed the cap on his phrase count and action count.

You implied it. Just because you do something "right" doesn't mean it won't fuck up other things.
HOORAYS

did you watch CI last week, Oyerth?
I did. I love Goldblum :D
I thought it was even better than the first Goldblum one
why does Acra think I'm interested in her game? :(
HELLO
she stopped talking to me anyway
That sounds like a terrible idea
It would be awesome
I meant to type /usr/lib and somehow got /usr/bin
Turns out I wanted bin, anyway

I never said anything about kicks.
HI
you commented on Bob Waffle's facebook
But you were speaking through him at the moment.
Unless he is also the science guy who fixes the lasers.
What's this you're showing me?
something US Patriot posted on facebook
Hahahahaha
I like his can-do attitude.
but what will you do if he pokes you back in return?
That's weird that US Patriot got married.
Who did he marry?
DO NOT WANT

I didn't want to say anything.

Er.
but the freezer is turned off, so really everything is okay!
but he runs out of air
exactly
everything is okay
It's dark.
Thanks.

Yes

hi!
Kevin Sorbet.
That's why we started this.
You're infringing on his right to humor.
30 mins instead of an hour?
I am guessing 40 minutes
instead of 48 minutes
Apparently that didn't go over too well.
there were several 2 minute commercial slots
and then the final commercial slot before the finale was "long"
Its like 20 minutes of ads for an hour here i think =\
it depends on the particular slow
Fucking ads

hi kevin_sorbo!

No.

I fixed it!
I am excited for your achievement
It's so slow. :(
And slow

I made about $80.

Don't eat it, Asimir.

i want a slurpee too!
OH FUCK
I just had the opportunity to say "I voted for your MOM!"
And it wasn't a joke!
No, I said it

i reject your reality and substitute my own

I might've been Eggbot. I don't remember! D:
aww you know my secret name :3
So let's have it.
and how to type it in Armenien
I think it's sleep().
time.sleep() just pauses everything
And cuddle()
Didn't we go through this before, K-hos?
It was in a threading module or something.
I think so
I just went to python.com to look for some documentation, and it was a porn site.
if you can get key presses then you could do a while loop

Hooray for Picso!
I tied it up in a pretty little while loop bow and now you hit the spacebar to continue.
While loops eat CPU time
(if they're empty)
It sleeps until you press a key, and if it isn't the one I want then it loops.
Now all I have to do is make the game.
are you making that game with the objects that do things?
The easy part!
Not yet.
The Secret of Monkey Island is coming to the 360

It basically sorts through a list in order.
Like Ruby? for i in (1..10)
Range.
Or (1..10).each { |i| puts i }
Haskell has that too.
I'm stuck in Haskell mode at the moment.

twitter is actually pretty powerful though

Drag Me To Hell is the movie I'm uploading
Yeah, 3000 GB is closer to 2.1 million floppies.
If I did the math right. :|
No...
floppy robotcock :(
fucking tooltip :(
300 gigs = 213 333.333 floppies

Not 300
Minor error
(3 terabytes) / (1.44 megabytes) = 2 184 533.33
That's a good way to grow an urban legend, though.

Sure you're a Brit: you have an accent.
I made a speech error at work once and some lady asked if I was Canadian. :p
"Are you Canadian?" "Um... no......."
I should!
I will quest to find Colin.
What about your quest to find K-hos?
He lives south of Colin. I'll find Colin and then K-hos on the way back.
I'm boerd
What do you do all day?
I play TF2 sometimes
I play DnD with my friends on the weekend

I quit right around when third edition came out. :>
Mhmm
Bit easier not days
I remember when the second edition books came out with a whole bunch of tools, all on CD, sometime in like 1999 or something.
Nobody does.
and by highish i mean higher than level 5 :P
I remember playing a lot of rangers. :p
I'm playing a ranger right now :D

Beautiful day for doing portraits!
Remember when I wrote on my whiteboard with a Sharpie and it wouldn't come off?
Also
Permanent felt-tipped marker.

Whichever genius wrote this Firefly configuration thing accidentally made the password default to t=UTF-8
Did you look under K-hos's feet?
Yeah, but what about you and your ex? Are you buddies? :P
So basically you're taking a relationship consulting job in Louisiana.
OK
So it couldn't have changed

This is the final frontier, GuestBot.

Where's your dictionary?

Penn Treebank is a tagged corpus, which is useful for this.
huh
VirtuaKnitter and Rocket Horse Boots are both very fun games. 
Wii Knitting :>
So, while an untagged corpus may have "horse" in the list, a tagged corpus will also include a tag along with "horse" showing that it's a noun.
Wii Knitting sounds like fun. :D

iphones suck
burned out
put something heavy on top
Because you're drunk
I'm going to unscrew it and clean it out. I think it might just be a load of dust jamming it up
it was very very dusty when I tried to use it
Why are you still using a PS1 :0
I have no clue
Because he's 1337
I've set my laptop up to work exactly like a ps1
That reminds me... I was going to buy Bushido Blade and I never did.
oh, that's right
I wanted to play the game that was in the ps1 at the time
Bowling is a grand time

Increase your low self-esteem and forget your penis!
"I Hate That" would be a good name for a band.
I wouldn't vote for Oyerth.
He's not racist enough.
What's the BNP?
"The British National Party (BNP) is a far-right and whites-only political party in the United Kingdom."
Last time I bought a battery I bought it on Amazon.
I think 47th Street Photo was the supplier.

Never again shall we speak of the banned one
So when I try to use SOP, it tells me to use access

I think it would be best to just use "saying goodbye"

I beat Metal Gear!
I started playing Metal Gear 2, but it's different and scary, so I stopped.
Man.
I'm not tired today, my eyes are all clear, my hair was messed just the right amount, I had the perfect stubble length.
Sleeping!
Hey.
That's serious
Wine is supposed to be harmless :(
I switched to Pidgin's IRC window with Super+Tab.
Haha. I always forget about the ring switcher
I like it :3
And the ring switcher seems to have a bit of a delay after you've chosen a window
Yeah :(
That's not the ring switcher!
I basically think I'm going to stay away from WINE and AOEII
man fuck
I don't even know what I said that time
My wireless LED doesn't work :(
The last episode of S3 pwned face
i've seen episodes of S5 so I know what happens :D
hi lewisreed!
No not yet.
He's the greatest :3
Which video drivers do you use?
Not too sure
FANTASTIC
I don't know what caused it last time
Of course, I didn't really take note of it before, simply writing it off as a random system crash that happens for seemingly no reason
I should find my copy and play you
There is a .gif on a wikipedia pag
internets is slow D:
Torrents will do that
Limit it
That's almost my whole  connection Zyrjello :(
100 KB/s
You didn't specify 
I was wrong the first time
I know this
I'm doing over 400KB/s right now
We can't get any faster out here
It's the same company as our phone
At me and my friend's apartment, we're just going to get internet
Per second?
I want EB's connection
It's only a little better than mine
Do a fiber optic cable
one cable the whole way
Or a really, really strong wifi router
lewisreed couldn't afford that! :P
And takes 40 years to get back :P
!!!!!!
pish tosh
Still atrociously slow though
yeah I'm doanloading this vid at 66.61KB/s
It's funny how clouds effect it negatively 
DO NOT SAY WOULD
My school blocked torrents
Because she's a stupid whore
Is that right before a dive bar?
I'm getting over 700KB/s a second on one of my torrents
And that's with one more seed than I had before
Weeeee!
<3 Zyrjello
but my bro gets 60 :S
And it's worse at school
Only about 6 more minutes and I'm down
done*
What did I say that time?
about

I forgot
Oh man :(
It has some funny parts
But as a whole, it's alright 
kung pow :|
That.
Futurama movies :D
Damn word list
I didn't know it existed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama#DVD_movies
Into the Wild Green Yonder
Tenacious D
Sweeny Todd has some comic value, and one of the few musicals I like
or hot fuzz
I haven't seen Hot Fuzz in a while
You need a better connection
Amazing movie, not a comedy, but awesome
"Be Kind Rewind" would be a good name for a band.
Army Of Darkness (THIS. IS. MY. BOOMSTICK!)
Shop Smart, Shop S Mart
35 KB/s? wtf is this shit.
anyone ever heard of Stein Mart?
But I like the sound of it
I'd never heard of it until recent TV commercials
I thought it was a parody of Walmart when I first saw the commerical
Really?
They once went as low as 1.2GHz, I believe
However, if I could upgrade my desktops vid card, I could run it just fine
I don't need more CPU power, my GPU is the only thing "holding" my desktop back
Fairly well
Granted my 9800GT is OCd 
I haven't measured my framerate on any games
Oh god yes, going from my Mac to my desktop playing WoW
Looked so much nicer
Hmmm...
heard too
You're like "oh man, this is running nicely"
SMASH
Then you run to a place with a few more objects
Blackness pwned
I've never done it personally
Of course, I've only ever really had crappy Intel chipsets
EVGA is apparently nice about overclocking
But I haven't touched it
EVGA is a great company
It is still quoting my chessboard :D
Or my cache is fucked up.....
I just remembered I never installed the fan on my video card
None of those work, I've tried them all :0
CTRL+F5 works on Linux and Windows.
Duh :P
I should really install this fan :(
Damnit
This webpage is still fucked up
I loaded it when I was tethering my phone with a bad signal
I've reset my cache and such, still won't fix it
My video card fan
But in Safari it works fine :0
It doesn't have one built in?
Either way, I have one in a little box
So why not? :P
You should :
Yes it is! :D
I guess it does have a fan built in
More airflow can't hurt :)
Maybe it can!
Lower temperature is better
OC that bitch like 500GHz
Subzero would be best :3
There's that one video of like a 1.2GHz processor getting OCd to 3 with liquid nitrogen 
AHHHH!! EGGBOT, HAND ME A FUCKING GRENADE!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF8S3Nn7mTQ

The guys on DP last night were talking about their Phenoms

Makes me play it in Real Player
I need sleep
I think I'll do what Marc did
Ultimatiums are relationship killers
Why not :(. I need help ;_;
But I'm not that mean 
What's the name of it?
Hey I found it :D
Yeah I know :(
Thanks

I followed the no contact rule and my sex called me in a little more than a week
Yeah she lives in Louisiana and I live in Ohio
Ali has insinuated that we should have sex
The other day, for example, I said something about how I don't sleep naked with most people, only people I'm in relationships with
aboot*
She asked if I'd sleep naked with her, I said we're not in a relationship, then she said that she'd sleep naked with me :0
I CAN"T LET YOU DO THAT
I FORGOT THE BEER!!! WHAT TO DO?! WHAT TO DO?!
How are you this morning?
Speaking of sleep
I'm hitting the sack
HI EGGBOT AAAAAAAAAAA
DOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW
the omegle topic was locked :(
Whiskey Sour Recipe
Good name for a band
My display driver crashed while I was out :(
There are no updates available
Stupid nvidia
true
The damn thing is impossibly skewered
where is this topic
was it too much fun
Because of Sir Pimpalot's post
He just repeats "Death" in Chinese in a very long line :/
And he takes joy in ruining our fun, as we all already know
I see why the last omegle topic was locked :-S
I have to delete my TKZ cookies to make locked topics visible, don't I?
Didn't fucking work
worst forum ever
In real life.
why don't you just ban him
Colin is one of the few online people I would actually ROCK OUT WITH.
Slim. :P
I don't even have a passport. :(
I don't either.
That's going to make things difficult! :D
I want to meet Asimir!
It won't. :(
a road trip eh
The secret undersea road
I say we all meet up and make a sequel to "the sweetest thing ever."
The new Killzone maps are out today :D
GO NORTH TO ECHO
You must be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
boo!
AHH!
That's quite a lot of cable
In trade school, we bought several spindles of 1000ft to network the dormitories
Except 75 feet is way too much
I only have 2 feet, and they're good enough for me
K-hos has none
They were chopped off
Yeah that's the way it usually works out, Zyrjello
I bought a $90 watch for just $30 off of Amazon
50 ft would be way too much
I can get one free if I sign up for an Amazon Visa card :P
 You Save: $112.99 (87%)
I have a question
how the fuck is my access denied to botserv
Since you deleted them all
I badworded Colin because Colin destroyed the old badwords list
I did that because it had outlived its purpose
some clever individual took me off the SOP list again
zyr couldn't get it to work
Only because I did it wrong :P
aaand my truetype font
because you do things like deleted the badwords list
deleting, rather
(12:28:22 AM) kos-hos left the room (Kicked by Colin (k-hos sucks)).
(12:28:47 AM) Colin: four months
is it really that important to have the bot kick people all the time for saying benign words
I found a working add-on that minimizes Songbird to the tray
Zyr, we're having a discussion here
I want to get drunk
but I don't think I have enough alcohol
please donate some :(
the lining of an anus will absorb the alchohol very quickly.  You can get more out of less that way.
I know, but I don't want to shove a beer bottle up my ass :(
I have one up there right now
well, I guess that solves my problem
Hey
I could go for some eggs on toast right now
well, it WOULD
nada
*shoes too
wheeee
I was trying to play TF2 but my keyboard wasn't responding properly
why do I timeout every other page on tkz
makes sense
Yeah, I'm trying to
so playerlocation(0,myx,myy,mylayer) would update myx/myy with what you want

yup
This is so frustrating!
Not keyboard
sub character
also I know thats missing an i
Me likey :)
It's royalty

All hail the Sun of K-hos!
they would look much cooler if it was the same size I drew it at
Quite a dense region of the universe
the sun has one too :P
oh they have one?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Booty
but it would be awesome, you could build your stuff on the ocean!
I haven't actually played it :(
I wonder if the'sa demo on PSN
hexes? it must be turn based
because AoE's sea battles were the best
3 had limits on the number of certain units you could have for sure, separate from population
(so did age of mythology)
but I know for a fact that some units are limited on top of population in 3
New batteries
Those keys seem to work
you should have
what are you going to do with a wireless keyboard
That might help
and by increasing the resolution I meant decreasing it
Yeah increase your DPI
increase your eyes
I'm glad you got kicked

It's good for you. :(
There's no ice.

Why do people still use popup ads?
I hate K-hos.
Kill him.

Write back to the socket that's receiving
One way chat is boring. :(

I should have paid attention when we discussed chart parsers in class
I don't know what it has with it at all, though.
It includes an English-language module with inflection, pluralization, conjunctions, indefinite articles, present participles, ordinal numbers, numbers to words, general quantification, integration with WordNet?Â® and CMU's LinkGrammar?, as well as a framework? for providing modules for other languages?.

If anything, you need a z3ro handler.

zzzsucks
You should toss the first part of the hostname
That changes often
Just delete it :P
You used ==
don't know how to do that >_<
Boooooooo
It only seems to flood for you
is it because I asked it to show one of its handlers before it had finished listing them all?
You already know what it's called :P
I was looking for one with regex in so I could c&p and edit

Man, I'm glad I didn't go to Chicago with my brother today.
He went there to buy his old car back, and he happened to be able to get a ride with a friend of my grandfather's who was traveling in the same direction for a dealer trade or something. But, on the way down, the trailer started to fall apart and the truck was having mechanical trouble, so they had to get repairs at a dealer or something.
bwahAhahAAHAhAhAhhhahaHA
I'm drowning. :(
With rape
You can if they have no crotch

You probably need some id, first. :P
I think that's what it's like in Michigan. A course, $200 for the license and another $150 for the course or something, plus the cost of owning a gun.
Not too sure what it is in Ohio
The course is 120
$105.

We once had a lady trying to return walmart brand items to my store
We've had people try and return all manner of Kodak products to us before. :P
Kodak sucks >_<
And one lady, after buying a bunch of film, asked, "who do I make the check out to? Kodak?"
"Make the check out to Hokanson's." "How do you spell that?" "H-O-K-A-N-S-O-N."
And then she said I was veryy rude

What's wrong with this sub :(?
what's wrong with it is that you only gave it two positional arguments
The last one is given
it's count, defaults to one
So there are 3, but I think my regular expression isn't being counted for whatever reason
As if I put a 1 in for count, it still fails, same error
you're stupid
I need eggbot :(
Then you suck!
You're kind of stupid, aren't you?

Do a lot
you don't mud, though :(
zzz, what do you need? :P
halp with my regular expression in python
TypeError: sub() takes at least 3 positional arguments (2 given)
The last one is given, so I think my regular expression isn't being read, so only the last two are
And I dunno how to fix that
Oh. I dunno, that's how you replace. re.sub
p = re.compile('your regex')
Good job failing
The Python programming culture doesn't really seem to do regular expressions.
otherwise it would be screwing up your quote marks
Tell me what you're trying to do
plz
In single quotes
  File "D:\Programming\python\test1.py", line 15, in <module>
  File "D:\Python30\lib\sre_parse.py", line 692, in parse
    itemsappend(_parse(source, state))
Start form the beginning
in soup
    p = sre_parse.parse(p, flags)
    raise error("nothing to repeat")
It means "zero or more of this item"
I thought * was wildcard!
So "zero or more of nothing"
. is any character except newlines
. is any character sexcept newlines
(.+) would capture a group of characters
only tame cards here folks

surely it depends on what you're drawing the maps with
both of those were redrawing the board tile by tile each loop instead of drawing it to a big buffer thing and being done with it
they're 74*72 pixel tiles, cuet
He doesn't use regex though!
Also, why don't you draw it to a buffer?
do you know of a place where sailors hang out?

I have never seen that before
I guess I just remember it from you quoting it some time before
not only does msn refuse to go right to the top of the screen, when I close it and open it again it moves itself away from all sides of the screen and puts a huge gap above itself
this is ridiculous. Why did they make it have its own ugly theme instead of following your computer's theme, and why the hell don't they want it to go to the top of the screen?
there are programs to change the theme, but yeah it would look better if it mached :/
well what do you mean top of the screen? so that the title bar is at the top?
but I use a newer one, too, I think
if I try to drag it to the top it moves it down again so there's about a five pixel gap
then when I close it and reopen it it moves it even further down so the gap is about 30 pixels
I think I know why that is, at least the 5 pixel gap may be because there is a border around it (vista style) that is normaly hidden
You're a border around it (vista style) that is normaly hidden
you could try whatever it is z3ro uses
Pidgin?

Windows Live Messenger sucks

ArmA 2 uses the FADE DRM system. If the software detects that it was pirated, this system gradually removes features of the game as the user plays it, eventually rendering it unplayable.
It's the passive-aggressive copy protection
I once bought a lot and the seller threw in a free Zyrjello.
I think it was stolen. :d

You're poisonous
But they're not enven venomnous
daddy longlegs are poisonous, venomnous, and want to take over the world
Also, they get twice as big with each generation
They live a peaceful life.
Soon, they will tower over us all
nobody knows about it because it's all under wraps by the government
The government is pro-giant arachnids
they are eight-legged freaks!
Little known fact: Much of the government is made up of arachnids
zzz: it rained today, I could show you rain,
well depending on the daddy long leg being referred to, they can be venomous
Pholcidaes are also sometimes called daddy longlegs, but are infact spiders

I'm buying Lightroom soon, and it does just about everything I do in its Develop mode.
Ugh. Not now. It will only slow the Oblivion download
I must have undone a fix
I've only used 2 and 4 but, 4 has a much better ui and seems to use memory better
and the thing that pissed me off the most about 2 was when you zoom in there was no buffer around the canvas, so you would be drawing on the edge of your screen
Piracy of the seas!
And, now that I'm buying Lightroom, about the only thing I need Photoshop for is to do some retouching or to add a border to my image. :p
you should
I need a Zenfolio account. :(
HELLO THERE

if you have an sextra camera it would be cool to leave the shutter open over a few fireworks :P

We don't have those.
Lens are good, cheap, and plentiful. The bodies are sturdy with good quality, and antishake is built into the camera body.
I'd consider a Nikon system, too, but for me antishake is a deal breaker.
And Pentax manual lenses are plentiful. The K1000 used to be the gold standard in entry level SLRs.
That 18-55mm isn't all that great as a macro lens, though. It only has 1:3 magnification.

Okay, I got into msconfig :)
I can make Windows work fine, but I still think it sucks

Google Maps has given me slightly wrong directions twice.
Wrong enough to lead me in the wrong direction, away from where I'm trying to get. >_>

"Hello Dr. Munn, this is Curt Anderson, an incoming grad student this fall. I was wondering when I would get information about new student orientation, picking classes, and so on. A couple friends attending other universities have this information already, and I am concerned that it was sent to me but lost in the mail. Thanks,
He'll send you a three word reply :P
He will.

Who ya gonna call?
How is this helping me? :(

So you can stop complaining

K-hos already slept all day.

K-hos is my friend.

It is not, OllieBot.
I don't know who haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii^hmm^ is.
i never woke up again

second time I've said blacks instead of blocks
K-hos is racist
I'll delete the k-hos one

Eggbot is a grumpy old man
hi Space_Pope!
Space_Pope is a jerk that fights space bears
:()
dood
oh well it will work for now
No friends in common
No idea who she is
I'm friends with an Evy Maarawi.
We would have a friend in common if you did :D
Maybe it is her
Because I imported my contact list a while back
I dunno why she would though, I was a huge nerd!
A wordban (meaning if you have the word in the post, you get banned) was put on boxxy
It was lulzie
don't post retarded videos on the internet
But Google still does
very, very few
My solutions would work 99.9999% of the times a frame would
That's always practical, Eggbot! :D
That's one of your creations, isn't it, Zyr?
k-hos is luffly :3
SearchTempest uses iframes to display Craigslist junk.
I'm going over to my friend's house :X
He doesn't like you either.

Thank you for your time.

I learned how to bone models today.
Ah. :)
All of the others seem to work
Yeah, it's really cool moving them around when you're finished.
So, what is it a skeletal frame of?
The RCA cable that goes from my switch to my stereo has just about had it
What do you need a pistol for? Preparing for the zombie apocalypse already?
Then he'd want a rifle
Like Eggy would be able to use something as heavy as a rifle with any kind of proficiency? As if.
All of the above
For shame.
BAN WARS
.k Colonel_Eggbot ___ up
.k Colonel_Eggbot ahhhhhh up
Don't we all?
Or... ban him
the whole leaving and joining thing is annoying
Next response: You're annoying, K-hos (Ban)
you can message channels that alloy outside messages I think
It doesn't sit there because you can use it on foreign channels, too
You're correct
Run by me
I think I still have the original complaint log from when the joke ran its course last year.
Here we go!
Too much K-hos (zyry, 8/18)
Just a sampling. :3
Omegle added a message telling people that asl is boring.
Similarly
Why is the rum gone?
That's a sweet dream.
lies is better than ok
don't change the subject
Though, admittedly, they do sound similar... I guess.
Now he's talking to people who aren't here.
You: Are there no pirates willing to seed Hanna Montana?
Your conversational partner has disconnected."
Someone filed another complaint about me. :(
I don't think I have any triggers yet. :3
Done
So, sure, why not?
zzz is way out of the loop
So we can kick him in the teeth for his lack of in-loopyness?
It'll be difficult to have a party with no beer or rum. :/
who says we have neither?
Why is the rum always gone?
that's why
It hasn't been ruined yet
Olliebot: kick zzz
Did you just manage to kick your own ass?
"zzz doesn't get kicked enough"
I think the Bureaucrat is my new hero. :3
I think that's the loosest basically I've ever heard.
K-hos: oyerth asimir z3ro eggbot k-hos forever fuck you banana they're taking the hobbets to isengard!
Query: What the devilfish is the deal with OllieBot?
Olliebot is the community bot, Acra
I'm not familiar with fish biology, but I don't think fish HAVE dicks.
Then Colin sugggested that it's less a wiki bot and more an oligarchy bot
zyr mentioned that
he just said it
poor sevene :(
His wisdom can't be comprehended here. :(
olliebot: acra sucks or acra sucks?
K-hos: acra is awesome
Bahaha
You're a good joke
Oh. He killed Asi as a way to express his love for you, Eggy.
acra is ___

"In The Mail" would be a good name for a band.
Someone delete that trigger.
I'm, like, obsessed with the "I'm On A Boat" video :(

You're from Canada.
I feel old some days.
you still have about 49.37 years to live
theoretically
That's refreshing.

it's not about how long you live life
That's not true.
why is that?
Eggbot will outlive everyone
VLC can't handle this ISO

They're idiots, as it has been pointed out
Everyone watch Raiders of the Lost Ark now!
the things i post on tkz
Witty insults?
have you seen my awesome wallpaper robot anime girl
there is a new one?

Well, nobody can name someone else, so it seems that way.
That's why we banned you.
I can get fired for that. :>
anyway, I have an animation program to make
This crew right here, plus Asimir, are the most interesting people TKZ has to offer.
..What about Colin?
Stop being so judgmental :|
With your mom.
Colin hasn't been here in awhile

He found a cooler group of people.
But they're actually just losers.

I like furry romance.

You can all go die in a firel.
thanks, guys
but it's nothing special
i just have to be myself, you know?
Does he actually think he can get a rise out of us? :P
What's this about being scared off by words?
no one reads them
Eggbot is a variable
Everybody's blog at TKZ sucks.
You're a blog's
tkz is a mess
Me neither
I used to read Cesque's.

Oh, that's too bad. Maybe you should take a nap today.
This is Eggbot, hailing Oyerth. Oyerth, please respond.
*cry*
No kitties. :(
Maybe I'll discover a new artist I like. :d
that's my skin! :(
Your friends don't want to hire you.
Tumors do.
You may get fat after this operation, Oyerth, but that won't be a problem for you.
you're just fat and ugly

When was the last time I did anything? :P
When you ravaged zzz
I blame Zyrjello
Olliebot's image is slow as fuck.
Anything good in theaters?
hi guise
I didn't know I made a request!
I don't know that I actually have permission to use ini_set on that server
So we'll see if the timeout actually works
It would be nice if I could use wget for this
Found an error :/
Wait... what?

Fuck peones
Do I get to give a reason for bans?
I thought you had to :/

Sorry Eggbot
I'm powerless

Yeah, Asimir.
S/he tried to get a rise out of us
ANd I was confused
It wasn't really anything.

there's only one way to find out...
I'm going to connect five clients from another host, but that host has only telnet
no IRC client
what's nc?
Then USER username something something realname
Like telnet, but a bit more versatile
now to do this four more times
Trying 204.8.34.130...
Connected to us.iso.rizon.net.
this is a shared host
anyway, I tried it again
USER c1 c1 c1 c1
now it's not letting another connection on
(I give up)
(Me too)
*to use irc
one particular server doesn't allow multiple clients from the same IP
I just need to use a particular server rather than the main irc.rizon.net
USER q q q q

now we're talking
You're a failure, zyr
You are a failure, zyr
There are no benefits
The next rank requires you to browse the web over telnet
You message HostServ "ON"
I know how to do it
but on most networks it happens automatically
it never happened for me on rizon though
let's see if I get better results this time

I had to go buy a mouse

You should really play pokemon
if I wanted to play pokemon I would play on -- wait for it -- shoddy battle
So what you're saying is
OllieBot agrees
I'm not that good at the moment
you can come play on shoddy battle anyway
so as I was saying, you should come on shoddy battle
Perhaps I will
After I beat Platinum 
I don't actually play the game

you might like this essay I wrote yesterday http://colinjf.com/misc/codecreditessay.pdf
part 2 in particular is some pretty good content
I got tired somewhere around page five though
(this one isn't pokemon related obviously, but it reminded me of that backlog)
I thought the red square in red part 2 of this essay in particular was pretty clever
Because that would be awesome
you guys are just lucky that I never made posts that were six printed pages when I was active on the TKZ
We have enough people who do that
(deathworks' posts are not anywhere near as long as the essay we are talking about)
well, acras last news post was like, 4000 words
you know what's pissing me off right now?
Well, not alone

Why does TKZ thÃ®nk its like 2-3 days in the future? :(

Thaw, Firefox!
Now I crashed Nautilus
Stop breaking stuff, Zyrjello!
I should finish that thing
thats what she said?
Already?
But its broadcast # is 11?
wat?
Were they broadcasted out of order or something?
Yeah, I don't understand that
That would cause problems
But I don't even know where the most recent archive is :P
it just uses a .hg directory

But apaprently he's pretty easy to catch of the legendaries 
because giratina, as a creature of the void, doesn't eat
I could kill him easily 
For some reason, Compiz didn't have a window decorator selected
I thought I had it with an ultraball
It did its last wiggle then broke :(

He used all of his pp for his two most deadly moves
Gameboys have shoulder buttons now?

An intense base line
"Post-punk revival, Darkwave, Electro, Gothic rock"
They're in their own genre imo
I want to fucking tear you apart
friendship hello!
OH NO :(
hi k-hos ^__^
hay olliebot, fuck you
Because I didn't know where Michigan and Indiana are. :>
Olliebot: banana or k-hos or z3ro or asimir or oyerth or ______?
waka waka waka
None of the name triggers exist anymore, K-hos
Eggbot would be the lead singer! :D
All he needs is a tan and to learn mock Japanese
wololo
but you didn't give me it ;_;
or change their avatars
two of you can!
Show me
I can probably delete that
RIGHT NOW
Next time he does something stupid he gets a ban
halsbaslanslajsnaalsjdnahsgflaopsapapaaapa
k-hos!
"Goat Penis Bacteria Adds to Food Safety Scare"
hola acra
hey acra
aloha acra
It's safe. :d
don't shrapnel wound people, k-hos
I doubt it
Yeah, he might secretly hate you and be trying to ruin your day because he's a big fat loser!
oyerth is cool
I still can't believe Auron actually wanted him after showing his 'talents'. I mean.. really.
That thing was scary. ;_;
I guess some people really don't have standards.
i guess some people are just born that way
but then tkz might never have been created :(
fact: Vampz is a joke
You're a joke
Of course I was.
I feel violated
fact: Asimir is more fun than Colin.
how have you been anyway, Acra?
what are you studying?
..I'm.. apparently, studying the best way to survive a superrabies mass-infection.
I plan on taking zero biology classes
Yeah. Not all problems in Biology can be solved with MORE DAKKA. :(
however, even after last year, I still have more credits from IB
colin is a lot of fun
fuck you acra
you did?
what if they hire me to be a friend?
I need a good Heist movie to watch.
k-hos is mean!
I have to leave for work in 5 hours
Yet I despise 6-1 like I worked today
between the morning and the afternoon?
BFFs
friends for a time
"Kayli Pile  A wise girl kisses, but doesn't love, Listens but doesn't believe, And leaves before she is left (:"
the two aren't mutually exclusive ;)
Haha. I posted that
WTF??!!!
But what does that have to do with killing me with grapefruit?
naw brah
remember flaming text dot com?
I wasn't talking to you jerk
But I like to spend my time doing other manly things
Like lifting heavy objects and grunting
w t f
zzz is pretty manly for a girl
pritty fly for a white guy
yayw
aww!
whoever did that missed an o from whooops
he's luffly :(
but you taste like fear and chocolate
HOLYCRAPOPS
olliebot, even in this failing economy, people will buy anything that makes a wrrring noise
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
I think so, but I don't think Bruce Campbell ever met Princess Di.
hey sevene what's crackin
that'd be kinda cool
Do it
which handler is it?
You're fine
at least you are a shape and not shapes...like an amoeba
I think so, but how are we going to market a sonic screwdriver in this economy?
I think so, but where are we going to find six midgets and a mime at this time of the night?
I like the new one!
So, what are we going to do tomorrow night, Olliebot?
#luff
TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD
rape k-hos
now, I don't want to do anything illegal but I would kill someone in front of their own mother if I don't get that 10-speed
How else would you do it?
the whole damn thing at once of course!
You can try doing it all at once
do shorts count?
I'll tell you if it fucks up the order
Okay, first: that was stupid
key
(commas)
Okay, two are okay
i didn't actually notice the commas at the ends
That's how you ALWAYS separate array elements
I also never worked with arrays
In any language?
any
are you thinking what i'm thinking k-hos?
I tried to fix it
Yep, still out of order
msg is assigned after the if
I didn't do it this time
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I think so, but he never gave up the location of the buried treasure before he died.
I think so, but an oven that spanks people would probably break numerous health and safety laws.
I think so, but when was the last time a Jack-O-Lantern solved any major problems?
I think so, but where are we going to get a tutu that fits Oyerth?
It's because he's fat!
are you thinking what i'm thinking
stop nick alerting me! :(
I HATE YOU ASIMIR >_<
I made it dump all the handler code to a file
So I can always have an updated version of my scrath file
The same thing we do every night, Zyrjello. Try to take over the world!
I think so, but wasn't that just a myth?
I think so, but we'd need at least three people in order to kill her.
Hey wait
Did I just overwrite it?
What are we going to do tomorrow night, OllieBot?
i think zyrjello is having way too much fun right now
Fixed the problem where it wouldn't respond to its name
The first atom bombs were in New Mexico or some shit
are you _____ what I'm _____?
asimir :(
"Bitches Bitches Bitches" would be a good name for a band.
Your band names are terrible, OllieBot
whoa i just saw that
i luff u too :3
There was a 450 MB update. :|

Cuet is my favorite webmaster
the url had the word 'fish' in it
you are a goldfish
i hate you!
except it's still 4chon
the four leaf clover
that is all
No, I sort of got that. I'm talking about sevene's clover nonsense.
'4chan' whose logo is a four-leaf clover sounds similar to 'fortune'
i'm saying that i never made that connection before
kind of barely
4chan is phonetically similar to fortune
i'm saying that they were similar
i vote for both
i like english
isn't that how you say 'train'?
i've never heard anyone say it with a hard 't'
'train' with a hard 't' would sound more like 'terrain'
the 't' used in 'train' is basically a 'ch' sound
close
Hardly.
You guys have nutty accents, eh?
Oh, it is. Until you try to drill a specific point.
does anyone have a screencap of the simpsons when mr burns goes all paranoid like howard hughes

And, anyway, what would happen to words like 'the' and 'though'?
her eye's leaking
also huge eyes
Knowing K-hos, I bet that's actually a guy.
it's a girl :|
You're a girl :|
'th' is just a slightly stronger pronounced version of 'd'
Well, if you're, like... I dunno, Russian, maybe.
just in different magnitudes
thats why it's practice :P
so I get better
for fun, i'm guessing
No, I meant, you wanted more depth in the critique of WHY it looks good.
You're dead, cuet. All you can make now is compost.
making

AND TKZ HAS BEEN FUCKED UP FOR SEVERAL DAYS
wtf!
Y'know, cuet and sevene; you're the REAL mopey bitches around here, not I.

hey faggot
zyry
Well, you're both all like 'WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNG evrything anyone every does is be always of the shitses!'
Whoa
Bye, other half
We're on different servers
If it was, K-hos wouldn't be flashing it around.
You do if you connect directly to a server!
It's certainly not anything made with the TK, though.
no it's a rpgmaker or gamemaker game

Oh, is this one of those things 4kids censored the fuck out of?
You're decaying? You should have that looked at.
Which is less than elegant

You're the third episode in both the japanese and american release

Looks like I may have to spend $16 then
if it's on your computer you could try pcsxe

I meant your hardware sir
what does sound have to do with it?
oh, I did get Disagea2 to run almost flawless

Hippos.
And you aren't already?
You'd rob a bank and burn down an orphanage and then say 'jk'. :\
don't make an issue of it
Pah, and I needed his advice. :/
You can ask us.
sounds reasonable
Well, ok. I'm just wondering about a few species and whether they should start wearing clothes. The two in real question right now are a fairly anoxeric race of lizards, and the other are Hanyas; pretty classical demons.
That's what differentiates us from lesser races.
They're NOT lesser races. :(
A crab is liable to get hanged for wearing clothes around here.
I'm pretty sure that lizards will be fine, but the real question is the Hanya.
Yeah, but are they GIANT ENEMY CRABS?
and consume its flesh
So... http://www.acra.com
Actually, this brings up another point; some races are QUITE close to one another.
For example, we've got the Kiang, which are just horselike humanoids. And there's also the Nenetaur, which are... Minotaur-like humanoids. :|
Why now?
*not
i thought it raptors would kill me for it or something
I guess the important question is... do they gallop?
Split the difference. Wear pants.
aka fashionistas
Only if you talk funny
Bye, Blenda
Oh well, at least I'm pretty sure that's the final nail in this coffin, as the remaining naked races just plain wouldn't work at all.
For instance, Golems.
i love you too sevene
You're a golem!
you should have a race of steel golems
They just look like hollow suits of armour.
hollowed suits of armor are so played out

That's the gayest thing I've heard all day.
So is anybody here fairly familiar with Blender?
G_Dragon!
firefox firefucked up
i taught ahmad bahjat.
I'm trying to find a way to flip part of a model so I can just copy/paste the left hand into the right hand.
I AM THE BLENDER MASTER
Just blend a second thumb on.
Neither reinstalling the graphics drivers nor downgrading them fixed it
But the whole screen is used when no nvidia drivers are installed

Oyerth, you're dying.

it doesn't take any time
I organize as soon as I get it, too.
PDFs of things go on the Desktop. Pictures I'm going to upload go on the Desktop. Downloaded files go on the Desktop. Folders of images go on the Desktop.
I save everything except for images to my desktop
A few things go to my home dir, but even that's mostly empty
My home directory is a lot cleaner.
If it's there, I make a sort-of attempt at putting stuff in folders.
My home directory's only loose files is generally pieces of code.
Plus this one loose porn video.

I've spent the past half hour or so working on designing this one lizard/snake guy. He dresses like a priest, so he's got all these wavy robes, but he can still pull his races bullshit and spend all day switching up his arms and feet's typical duties.
Yes. I'm sure ninja priests would make excellent doctors.
You're a passive ally.
But then I remembered that he actually would be an enemy for a little while, due to everything totally hitting the fan in Chapter 10.

"Pick Apart Acra's Plot Day" would be a good name for a band.

I've found that I find the most 16:9 wallpapers if you search "HDTV wallpapers"
16:9 wallpapers gets you the least results; 1960x1080 gets you the second most

The difference between 16:9 and 16:10 is insignificant. You can scale it up or down and hardly lose a thing

How did it get there, in the first place?

Then why hasn't he robbed a bank or something?
Because he's a bum
What about his girlfriend? Why can't she hook or strip or something?
Better question; why can't HE.. oh, right.. bum. Because that answers everything.
Oyerth would rather watch them get into bum fights.
I'd take in cuet if he was homeless.
A Zubat is their landlord?
I guess so. :(
Hmm... no filenames in inodes
Maybe he can do something about the giant crab infestations.
And also very capable of tearing a human in two. :|

Rabbits aren't trained killers; crabs are.
bunnies have teeth made for slicing though
you could jomp on the crab and kill it :/
Id just boil them
I don't think that shell could take 100+ gravity bound pounds
That thing can't weight more than forty pounds, though.
well yeah you could take the bunny out much easier if you could hit it
Hopping on the crab isn't a viable tactic, though.
I thought we were having a crab vs rabbit fight.
SOH NAP
unless the bunny could somehow bite it's eyes off
You might be able to hop on the crab and break some of its legs, but the thing would shear your leg clean off for doing so.
MELEE!!!!!!!1
It looks like you've been... disarmed.

I'm going to be having crab-related nightmares tonight. 
K-hos, don't lash out.
WikiBot sure has changed.
Gaaaagh.
And maybe raping me. If they're in the mood for it.
I don't drink.
I think It would have been things to do that that sort of thing, y'know?
Eh, I don't think much can top Diaos in sheer.. nastiness.
Think.. uh.. think Dr. Octopus, only with three times as many tentacles. And they're organic parts of his body. And they have retractable bladelets at thier tips. And.. he's not a very nice person.
A serial killer is much scarier than someone wanting to nuke the planet.
Maybe if you're Canadian.
do you think about these things a lot?
Not.. really?
Here in America we have guns so that serial killers can't get us.
Yeah, but so do they.
but if EVERYONE had guns serial killers wouldn't be a problem, you see

Sometimes I wonder if people from other regions call it Timmy Ho's
Nope.
You outcast
It's a nice, colorful name
In general, Tim Horton's aren't that big.
Couldn't have been that great.
If he was playing for the Sabers.
He also played for the Leafs
He died in a car crash on the QEW or something

I need a slideshow program.
hello chaps!
And pictures of Seafroggys.
We used to have his graduation pictures :(
Does he not have pictures on facebook?
Only 8 on Facebook
That's bullshit.
With all the pictures he whores on TKZ?
If anyone here has any pictures of Seafroggys, I'm going to need them.
I can get you those pictures
Fortunately, my voicemail number is my phone number!
There's a link to a gallery on croxis.net, but it's also broken
We're such stalkers :P
I thought you were homeless.
we have a few saving graces
i have until the first of the month before i have to leave
Your girlfriend is stripping?

I ran out of Colony RPG quotes, so I went with oldbie quotes at the end.
I think it works.
I like the pirate.
 not really
He should be enjoying this with us.
I'd love to see some of those pictures :P
WHO ARE YOU?!
Not you
Sometimes when we touch.
And I have to close my eyes and hide.
Till we both break down and cry.
First you have to fall asleep.
Seafroggys passed away peacefully in his bed this morning.
There's a thread on the forums for you to honor his memory.
hahaha the video

09 Saturn Aura
I like Saturns.
My parents have one and people always complain that they have to talk to Saturn themselves or they tell my parents just to bring it to one.
Actually, they didn't change the oil. They told me parents that Saturn is crap. :p
Saturn themselves said that their own mechanics have a hard time with the parts.
Was that in the group I gave you?
They obviously make it so you have to bring it to the dealerships.
So they can rip you off.
"Watch Your Language" would be a good name for a band.
Just find a competent mechanic. You might have to travel to Michigan to do so.
It's a problem of Saturn being douchebags during design.
The setup is so incredibly stupid.
Obviously such things are easily complicated.
more or less
I don't. :p
The mechanic looks at the car and says, well, this is strange, normally we don't have to remove this part, but for this we do so let's do it.
Because you suck.

Uh, his name escapes me.
Though, the fact of the matter is I suspect they're really only doing so because it's in their best interest to keep me happy.
what's going on on the TKZ these days anyway
A similar story with the other guy. He sent me a request to work on some new project. I said maybe. It wasn't some newbie moron, though.
Obivously if it was, I'd have said something so mean they'd flee TKZ forever.
what happened to that hello! guy who put bold all over the place
Friendship Hello? That was taco. :I
his last visit was june 17th but his last post was july 11th
how does that wokr
that about covers it for my monthly TKZ visit anyway
About the only other thin you've missed is zzz being a whiny sexist idiot in every other post he makes, and then Seafroggys yelling him out for it.
zooooooooooooooom!

Because of the Adama Maneuver

He was also very bad at teaching HTML, as we were forced to use dreamweaver, which does everything for you
It was actually more difficult for me, I didn't know how to use the shit UI so it'd take me forever to figure out how to do something
Also like, everything was fixed width :(

I was confident nobody else had said that before
Also, it was too relevant
lewisreed: no
We don't have that
But I don't want SNS, it costs too much
So, TBell or White Castle?
OllieBot: Tbell or White castle

I have a book about useless information.
I think it's called the Book of Useless Information.
The Dictionary of Theories is neat.
I have a book called "Fight Club," one of the worst things I've ever read

I got fightclub after I saw the movie
I have two Chuck books I need to read
I was joking :>
I think it's a bit overrated, but is still amazing
I think most things that are very popular are overrated though

I suppose I am at the age where people have adult relationships and get married.
I'm 23, Oyerth. There's a lot of people I know in serious relationships and in engagements.
I'm just saying, the average age for a woman to get married is right around twenty-two or twenty-three.
Or it used to be. I guess it's risen a little bit.
I guess it's more like 25 now, according to Wikipedia contributors.
IT'S SERIOUSLY FREAKING ME OUT

The hypothesis is that in general humans are pretty similar in their cognitive mapping abilities. Why would we all be different? There's no biological basis for such massive differences.
Well, I spent five years getting my undergraduate degree in cognitive science.

Well, actually, the only I've really spent is on my undergrad, and even that's only at about $25000.

i mean, the screen twitches everytime i collide with things
the tower didn't have that feature
my internets are being slow
You probably don't need half of them.
But for some reason, when I make an exe, it misses some dll files.
the camera would probably annoy me if this were a finished game
And yeah, I have to figure out how to do a smooth transition for the camera.
That part is easy.
then you can probably get rid of all of those dlls

What did you think of Monday's House, Picso?
I just hope it's not like last season, where it never hit its stride.
Yeah, hopefully having the old team back will bring back some of the greatness.
...Who said that one?
Hmm. There's a period after it.
You're a period after it.

Maybe.. you had TOO much fun?
But only a few months into the future
Prove it.

Apparently Arby's has a number on the back of their meal receipts that you can call, do a survey, and get a code for a free regular roast beef. Then you can use that code, get your sandwich, and then use the receipt from that sandwich to get another free one!
Recursive roast beef! :D
From 8am to 7pm all I had to eat was like five cups of coffee, a cookie, and a Snicker's bar. :|

I've come to a conclusion lately that's been building for a while.
I'm bad at being, making, and keeping friends.
Especially not Oyerth.

No matter how many you build . . .
I'll find a way to screw up my friendship with them.

mechanized infantry and tanks by 17th century!
Nobody fucking cares about your new Civ games
Did Civ 1 even have colours?
it is sad when 1 phalanx takes out a tank though :(
Travian would have been so much better with phalanxes killing tanks.
I think you mean 'back in 486'.
Time_Pope must be an absolute fossil to have played Civ 1, too.
time_pope is a wee lad
How old is Time_Pope?

Well, there's a thing where negative polarity items have to be licensed by a negative item at a higher position in the sentence and yada yada yada and part of this homework assignment involves having to use this fact to lend support for a hypothesis on argument structure.
And working with example sentences for too long destroys your own judgements on what's acceptable and what's not. :P

all of the friends are people i actually know
mostly from reall ife
this makes me pretty angry
i only found out about it because somebody in real life started talking about something "i" said on my facebook profile
you need to sign in to use "report profile" and apparently you can only report an imposter by linking to your real profile
so there won't be any reason to believe i am the real Colin Fitzptrick anyway
it's yours?
I'm joking. :P
i don't find impersonation very funny, but if it was actually you, i won't be that upset
I don't even know anyone from your real life.
well if it was you guys i imagine the people i know from real life might have just stumbled onto the profile themselves and assumed it was actually me
http://lifemetercomics.com/art/link_herbst.jpg
Well, Asimir and Oyerth both have been looking for you for months now on Facebook, so they were hoping that the Colin Fitzpatrick from Edmonton, AB on there was you.
I know they both friended one, pretty sure it wasn't you.
I know they're not 4chan-lite, but you're even more popular there than here. :P
sounds like something cuet would do :U
I can't guarantee it, but I don't think it's done by anyone I know.
by the way, if i actually used facebook, i would have just told you guys and added you... i wouldn't have kept it a secret
the reason i say i don't use facebook is that i actually don't use facebook
Well, it was a good theory.
Asimir did!
Was someone looking for me?
Fire alarm :(
I hate fire alarms.

Eye Accessing Cues.
Hmm?
The idea that when we remember visual things our eyes move in a specific direction, and another direction when we construct visual images, and then there's auditory, and so on.
It seems highly suspect to me, but NLP practitioners eat that shit up.
Did you get my FB message?
I found the summary on the same blog last night.
I'm not entirely grasping what you're saying anyway.
Ok. :P
Anyways, article was interesting, but not surprising.
Ooh.
You're an interesting point.
Sign language speakers are cool because they, presumably, use the same linguistic structures as everyone else. Except for phonological output, they have manual output.

LETZ B FRINDS
No you don't, Olliebot.
what the fuck is up with this shit
Like, say, how a child growing up can acquire a language even though their parents aren't perfect speakers. Children of immigrants, for example.
Or, even cooler, like the case of Nicaraguan Sign Language. A bunch of deaf children put together basically created their own sign language from nothing. 
So, I'm interested in how we structure verbs. There's some research suggesting an innate pattern for representing events, Agent Patient Action. Susan Goldin-Meadow, at the University of Chicago, had people describe using hand gestures what they saw in a video (like a woman eating a cookie), and the people overwhelmingly used Agent Patient Action order.
That's sort of the other problem. One hypothesis is that the children will piggyback the structure of the miniature language on their own language. So I'd ideally like to have bilingual children to control for an effect of native language.
I think I need to have Cristina as my advisor, since she seems open to all sorts of interesting ideas. She's really directed me to a lot of stuff done by computer scientists, which is cool.

My roommate keeps his own set of bowls and silverware in his room.
He never greets me. I've tried to talk to him before and he'll say like five words and run off.
Because you speak in random numbers and letters?

I have a torrent if you want to mess with it

Just watch it. :D
Well said, OllieBot.
Well, Acra's not so young and sexy anymore, either.
I'm twenty. :|
I know.
And depending on your definition, I doubt I ever did qualify as 'sexy'.
O..k? I don't see what that has to do with anything.
Well, wait. Are Goblins reptilian or mammilian?
Cowboy
Well.. ok.. uhm.. What if it happens to be a desert country where everyone wears turbans?
Highly recommended!
OllieBot, where can I get a Ycry shoe of my own?
the internets are pretty dull tonight
Try any fine shoe store.
I bought mine at Snyder's Shoes in Manistee, MI. :)
Period.
Screw it, I'll just go with what I already have available.
shoos
They come up to about, say, just below the knee. And they have fancy things drooping down from there.
I'm not getting hooves. :>

This difference between prescriptive and descriptive grammar seems to be confusing for people.

You're a liar, KittehBot!
I thought erasing Rory from time was kind of a cheap way to make Amy skip the grief

Everything that was sucked into the crack COMES BACK

Oh man. It's almost time for Bourne to get PISSED THE FUCK OFF

Because that's what I keep seeing when I glance at it
To who?
Because your avatar reminds me of him if I don't look closely
Oh no, the police are at my door. :(
I was a leading player in the push to create the Internet.
You might say I invented the Internet.
TKZ avatars are not named rationally
I can't get them by user ID
I'll have to pull them directly from Gabble
Good! >_<
Maybe you should have used a real language.
I guess so!
Speaking of Shattered Horizon, it's free to play this coming weekend

Looks like I broke Gabble :P

I had too much coffee today. I'm all jittery. :/
That's a lot of coffee
I'm going out for a drink in probably twenty minutes or so.
I haven't even applied the first one
I can't be bothered to reboot
Yeah. Waaay to early for a reboot.
I haven't shut it off since I turned it on. :)
Yeah. :)
It's finicky and crashes too much if you have a lot of PDFs open. But it looks nice. :(
That seems awfully Microsoft-like
Yeah, I know. :/
Particularly since the OS doesn't actually rely on Safari for things.
As far as I've ever been able to tell.

Zyrjello was succeeded on his death bed by his daughter.
well just the last one.
Was that the one with the Master?

Acra is creepy, Zyr. :(
They're your friends. You should be the scared one.
Is this movie any good
Not so great
Acra, was that your status?
He didn't recognize signed bytes at first :/
Isn't he work on engine updates or plugins or something?

why is it so fucking hot asimir :(
zyr are you excited for the DOCTOR WHO FINALE on saturday?
But I am excited
I feel like a single race probably could have pulled it off
I would agree except for the fact the doctor really has been fucking them all over pretty righteously
and the tardis :'(
i hope the tardis stays destroyed for a few episodes or something
You can break all its parts, but it just goes on killing

I still can't get on mystic software :(
Maybe try another DNS server

figured we'd just move along like it didn't happen. but you had to bring it up... oh well :C
You should take every opportunity to embarass people in #tkz
why is the topic "no"?

I could use the HTTP plugin to have the game fetch content from OllieBot :P

Yo.
Dwarf Fortress
I wish they would just leave. They can't get in and I don't need to go out.
My desktop runs Windows most of the time, since TF2 hasn't been ported to Linux yet :P
Oh yeah, that bug.
My fortress is filled with engravings of alligators my dwarves have never seen :/
I believe
Well...
And from there it's a fortress simulator
The learning curve is more of a wall
Once you become good at the game, you'll find more exciting ways to die horribly

Or getting set on fire by dragons

Eggbot is too ashamed to keep his bot heritage
And OllieBot is down until we fix the leak in my basement :(
OllieBot is a sophisticated mess
I have an IRC bot written in assembly in one of the directories of my home dir.
Why would you write netcode in assembly? You really are broken
I admit that, Zyrjello 
And then made it completely object-oriented
That's one thing that always gets me when I go back to Perl
zyr let's write an irc module for lolcode

Apparently I'm not the only onw who refuses to use cout and cin when writing something in C++
Why do you "refuse"?

yes. basically, how to efficiently pan for gold in the stream behind the school
Parrot: Raawk! But you're already a doctor!
I made varsity my sophomore year
school owned the claim to the stream, so they got any gold we found. wasn't much. I think the biggest nugget was about the size of a 'nerds' candy.
thats a bit much

Oh dear. I told my dwarves to fill a pit with water
But the water freezes as they pour it out
'Zyrjello' Thobbal is currently a high master engraver. He has three friends and owns 31 objects. He has been quite content lately.
'Oyerth' Mengkir is a farmer who excels at butchery and brewing and, by some clerical error, is female. She owns 32 objects and has three friends. Oyerth has been ecstatic lately.

can't you just sign the loan, and the next month pay 95% of it off?
I think paying 95% off the next month would be the best option
there are some 2018 models that offer $2500 - $3000 cash incentives, but only with financing, and i don't want to pay 6% in interest
you can be penalized for overpaying on the loan, that's the whole point of the agreement
Did you get your loan through a bank?
Through the dealer's bank

we should allow monopolies and oligopolies, because freedom™
dont play their game

probably not enough time to visit a brewpub 20 minutes away
enough to share
I was looking for quick info, nobody had it, so I've been looking at the options, and the options are that it depends on the dealership, credit history, etc
so i've done as much work as I can until I negotiate with the dealership
Don't talk to one. Shotgun everyone in 50-100 miles. Ask for their best price paid in full. Get a line for credit union financing. Work from there
Can you get a manufacturer cash incentive without being financed through the manufacturers financing program? That's the crux of the issue. I don't need an auto loan, I am trying to maximize the value.
I think we got another 500 from that
Also, while it's good to be informed,  try to push them with the out the door price. 3 cars ago they agreed to a price and tried to charge me 700 dollars for window etching.   So things like rebates and offers, you make them include that, rather than trying to get it on the back end
so i played fortnite battle royale today
seems pretty good

these nuts have little bits of dried tomato in them

😄
someone please find the part where we threw rein in the brig
excuse me we sunk TWO ships in that first clip
at one point i hid in an enemy ship after we killed them numerous times
you guys ran into rocks then too :>
oh. the storm didn't damage our ship. it just made the waves crest over on to our deck to fill our ship with water
"Gigantic Skull clouds will sometimes appear above the forts, visible for every player from a very large distance, swarming with powerful skeletons."

Damn. I knew they were going under but man that was fast.
man id love to go to a toysrus and buy a shitton of legos and action figures
if they close im hoping to pick up another nerf gun. those things are fun
ive always been partial to mechs, but you dont find those figures much. i suspect if i was in japan theyd be everywhere
and i completely avoided the seth mcfarlane 80 dollar action figure fad. that was fucking dumb.
THE DOMINATOR
but mr slinky spine. man.  loved watching him.
he shows up in philly a lot and tells people he's not bryz. it's hillarious. like of all the fucking people to hide as
im doing the gamepass thing for 2 weeks to see if it's worth it cause I don't know if I think it's worth 60 bucks.
i mean my xbox is in the closet so
It does seem a bit shallow for $60,t certainly a lot of fun
i'll probably do the game pass like oyerth
it's a play anywhere title so you can try it on both!
right, i'm done buying it every year
my one buddy and I play the franchise mode for the entire season every year, sometimes twice, so he buys it. its fun, but you really notice the lack of change when you're playing regular.  last year though, or the year before, when they added momventum to the skating, that was a big deal.
had that stupid song stuck in my head all weekend
why you make it pink?
Have a cookie 🍪
are on FIRE mlord
Quigs grab the like marmalade!
haha
then no
😦
I've found there's cracks in the frame, broken screw mounts, and the vent up top is also cracked.
Missing screws too.
oh man i forgot about that functionality
Some creepy old dude banging Ash's mom
why is that creepy
That's not creepy
squirtle squad was pretty cool. the charmander thing was just sad
also the beta closed at 2am PST
apparently there is also going to be a kraken that will randomly appear and attack ships in an area
I keep thinking of ways to make hte galleon more efficient, because Im thinking the sloop, outside of speed and power, is just better all around, since the division of labor is easier.
hi oyerth!
to confuse things, it means middle, or go-between
BDS
do you not?
that sounds like a fantastic idea, z3ro
SAIL!
I wanna go!
Someone come pick me up!
Ill steer the ship!
Who is Cliff and why did Quigs plow his face :(
none can say
lol yea
:D
Mine was either firing on a ship and seeing mike was somehow already fucking on it,  or all of us playing music on the bowspirit while chasing that poor sloop
I wish so badly that I was recording the part where the sloop circled back around and hit us
<:lenny:309451824488906752>
<:stupidsmile:384091519981846528>
but yea, at least zyr had a great view of the final moments
I liked needing to have the powder barrels to pull that off. I just wish we were equipped when chased.
sure did a fuck ton on deck
lol, dick.
i was also fired into a rock after i explicitly told you not to do that

someone find the bit where i blew up several people by cannoning a barrel that someone else was holding
like, blackwake has chain shot, grape shot, fires, torn sails, etc

sorry
your ship is always half borked
time to go home soon
oh wait i didn't toggle pirate mode this morning <:feelssadman:358637020672688131>
that sounds awful
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
Please refactor so that pirate speak is an output filter that can automatically apply to all messages in order to avoid repeated code
Then add a config value to toggle it on and off
the production code for the podcast ripper app lives in two branches because i didn't feel like converting half of it from ruby to nodejs

why cant we kick zyr now
Discord doesn't like you.

I'm just going to take out the trash and then I'll be on
Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job.
okay what are we playing?
i doubt matchmaking for bridge crew will come through for us
yea, aren't player levels super low?
so that should be neat

it's not like it's a fixed cost. if it's a cloud application they'll pay for the hardware capacity they need

that's racist
`Zyrjello: it's not like it's a fixed cost. if it's a cloud application they'll pay for the hardware capacity they need`

I can tell you from direct experience that isn't how Microsoft Studios works.
it's like you've never dealt with microsoft before, zyr
but they have azure 😦
and it's a very nice service for that part of the company
they probably use aws for their games 😛
but surely they're using azure, aws, or gcp

DO IT BAGEL
o captain my bagel
can't accept the invite until i pick a character
for a fun time, you guys should try and invite bagel
YOU ARE MAKING BAGEL VERY ANGERY

bagel has a thing where he receives all his invites at once about 15 minutes after you send them
it's the best
HERE I AM
oh boy, good luck

Any of you mooks still doing the keto diet?

one slice of white bread can have up to 17g of carbs in it alone
i'm gonna die
I generally stick to around 9ish g a day
Been flirting with less than 200lbs the last week or so
Is that near Oneida?
aww yiss! I knew you could do it!
which means I'll have to increase my caloric intake to compensate, but it's all good.
More like more coffee with coconut oil in it
D:
both of those things have too many carbs in them
you can't have milk on keto
wait for real?
i agree with zyr
but you're also active :p
z3ro you should get one of those 20k espresso machiens
maybe in equivalent amounts
yeah
Plus with coffee, you need a lot less to achieve the same effect
thats 2 and a half tacos of calories in your drink
and I've lost 65 lbs over two years doing this
yeah i lost a bunch too a few years ago. then i gained it all back D:
oh okay
lets start a running club quigsy
no need to worry about bread. we need bread for our runs
don't knock something you don't understand because you know better
two: one big meal and I end the day with one very small meal
^5.  you do you. im just wondering if there's a loss ratio of carbs to calories, because 2% might end up being the healthier option
i mean that's a common thing with people on keto. it's not really a "you do you" thing unless you mean it as the plural :p
he claimed jews contol the weather
man that was fun
"Jews control the weather"
and hes mr t!
and as many carb-based foods as possible
you can have whole grain bread
but you didn't say no bread at first
still quigs, better to just avoid them entirely and replace with something else
not having pizza sucks
you can do that fake pizza shit it's just not the same though
I still get it once in a great while
and i've tried it all
your sister made a badass breadless lasagna that i remember like 20 years later.
hmm
actually, it probably works
about 6 months
Here
nope. anyone gives you shit about the subject, you hand them that.  its more like a passport really.
*flashes zyr the quigs pass*
a spray bottle with vinegar, baking soda, and water (mostly water) works really well for grease.
don't clean anything. just replace it when its too dirty
i dont think a little lemon juice will solve bagel's problems
you should reply to them and say the credit check was denied because they put all that info in an email

What have you done with him
I mean, not for a pretty substantial amount of time
Okay, I'll try that
well at least you're honest about it
i will surely never recover from this
might as well just end it all
its ok we've learned from your mistake
i guess that's against the law
and my summer tires are on
Bluh
weird
Right?  Ducks sake

Tell everyone you were actually birthed twice, after the first ever occurence of a baby deciding it's not ready yet and crawling back inside
i was born on a saturday. Therefore, every saturday is my birthday and calls for a celebration containing alcohol
I was also born on a Saturday
let's also have a party
what level you up to in wow now?
oh you did the boost? nice. STill horde?
dont that figure. wows got pretty good cross-realm stuff though. I think we can play together regardless of realm if we're grouped.
unless that was your subtle way of telling me to fuck off, which im also okay with
didn't realize it was a pop thing
other mmo's have exp buffs and shit for new players
thought it was that
we've got both
he's got a horde DH (and Pally but hasn't played that in a bit) and an ally DK
i've got an ally mage and a horde monk
no just when it does
some allied races are available now tho
yep. now with hats
did you think this was more a meet and greet kind of thing?
also is the clicker for the presentation
Premise: people explain their theses in 3 minutes
this room is for advanced A/V techs

*literally*
you should all play a game drunk
perhaps if you display enough incompetence on the ice they'll spare you
that's my hope, rein
Otherwise you will be marked as an ignorant American
then I out

i have tabletop
I would try a one shot with y'all
I don't believe you
What's dread
one-shot tabletop RPG system that uses Jenga pulls instead of dice rolls
Did you see that Jay released a sane revision of rpj?

Dread sounds like it would be bad online
Nah. Not enough tactile feedback
good call
it's the "Oyerth's Basement" fund

Guys there's a movie out called Sherlock Gnomes
It scored 18% on Rotten Tomatoes

That's why he did Kevin Smith's last two movies.

we would need to have the right setup.  Maybe manually gen the world and delete all the hives within a substantial radius?

Crazy how they keep finding out my mailing address every time I move.

oyerth should take inspiration from /r/subredditsimulator and make bots that simulate each of us
